**Customer Assistance Response: Impact of Student Loans on Low-Income Students**

Dear [Customer Name],

Thank you for reaching out to us regarding the positioning of student loans, particularly concerning low-income students. We understand that the burden of student debt can significantly impact individuals pursuing higher education.

Recent findings highlight that low-income students are often compelled to rely on student loans to finance their education. Approximately 95% of dependent students from families with an annual income below $40,000 utilize federal loan programs. This reliance underscores not only the steep costs associated with pursuing higher education but also the limited financial resources available to these students.

A primary concern is that low-income borrowers frequently face substantial financial hardship, evidenced by late payments and negative credit impacts, particularly for those who do not complete their degrees. Data indicates that graduates typically experience an income boost of around $11,000 over two years compared to non-graduates, illustrating the importance of degree completion. Unfortunately, many low-income students encounter barriers such as financial instability, which can hinder their academic progress.

Moreover, while a notable decline in total student loan debt was observed in 2023, it is essential to recognize that a significant portion of this remaining debt burden still rests upon low-income students. Often, these students lack the generational wealth and resources necessary to navigate the complexities of repayment, exacerbating existing disparities in wealth and educational outcomes.

To foster understanding and support for our borrowers, we encourage exploring various repayment options, including Income-Driven Repayment (IDR) plans, tailored specifically for individuals with lower incomes. Awareness of these options is crucial, as limited information can lead to heightened financial stress and unmanageable debt.

We hope this information clarifies the complex relationship between student loans and low-income students. If you have further questions or need personalized assistance, please do not hesitate to reach out.

Warm regards,
