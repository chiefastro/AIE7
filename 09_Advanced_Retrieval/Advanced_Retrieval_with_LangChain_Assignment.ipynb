        "4. When we query our Retriever, we will do a similarity search comparing our query vector to the \"child chunks\".\n",

For example, some complaints mention not receiving notices or emails about repayment obligations or account transfers.\\n\\n2. **Systemic Errors and Mismanagement**: Errors such as incorrect account balances, mismatched figures, or late reporting to credit bureaus occurred due to mismanagement by loan servicers. Complaints highlight issues like incorrect account statuses, failure to verify debt legitimacy, and improper reporting that negatively impacted credit scores.\\n\\n3. **Inappropriate Handling of Forbearance and Payment Plans**: Borrowers were steered into long-term forbearance or improperly managed payment plans, often without understanding the accruing interest or alternative options like income-driven repayment. This led to interest accumulating rapidly, ballooning balances, and making repayment seemingly unmanageable.\\n\\n4. **High Interest Accumulation and Fees**: Some borrowers reported that interest kept accumulating due to the way payments were applied, especially when additional payments only covered interest rather than principal. In some cases, interest capitalization and fee stacking made the loans impossible to pay off.\\n\\n5. **Unfair Practices and Misleading Information**: Complaints describe servicer misconduct, including aggressive collection actions, selling loans without proper notice, or providing bad/inaccurate loan information. Some borrowers felt misled about their debt obligations or the terms of repayment.\\n\\n6. **External Hardships**: Borrowers faced significant financial hardships such as unemployment, homelessness, medical issues, or economic downturns (e.g., recession, fires), which prevented them from making payments.\\n\\n7. **Inconsistent or Inadequate Response from Servicers**: When borrowers sought assistance, many reported unhelpful or unresponsive customer service, difficulty accessing support, or being misdirected into unsuitable repayment options, thereby worsening their repayment difficulties.\\n\\nIn essence, the failure to pay back loans often stemmed from a combination of systemic mismanagement, lack of timely information, deceptive practices, and borrowers’ financial hardships.'"

However, we have made minor additions and clarifications to\\nexisting guidance in a few areas, as noted below.\\nChapter 1\\nIn Appendix B, we have added guidance on determining enrollment intensity for Pell Grant recipients who are enrolled in\\nsubscription-based programs.\\nChapter 2\\nWe have revised the discussion of <Allowable Costs= to clarify that for Pell Grant recipients with an enrollment\\nintensity below 50%, the cost of attendance (COA) is still based on the full-year costs for a full-time student. In this\\nsame section, we have also removed text noting that the FAFSA Simplification Act made certain changes to COA\\ncomponents. These changes are no longer new and were previously incorporated into the 2023-2024 FSA Handbook.\\nUnder <Tuition and Fees,= we have added health insurance premiums that are charged to all students as an\\nadditional example of a cost that may be included in this COA component.\\nWe have revised the text under <Costs of Obtaining a License, Certification, or First Professional Credential= to clarify\\nthat the guidance in this section pertains to credentials that are required for a student to practice or participate in\\nthe occupation the program is preparing the student to enter, and have added bar exam fees as an example of one\\nof the types of costs that may be included in this COA component.\\nUnder <Periods of Non-Attendance,= we have added language to clarify that a period of non-attendance is a period\\nduring which the student is not enrolled and is not otherwise engaged in any activity that is a requirement of the\\nstudent9s program of study.\\nChapter 3\\nUnder <Packaging Aid for Certain Dependents of Deceased Servicemembers or Public Safety Officers (Pell Grant Special\\nRule),= we have removed the note explaining that the Pell Grant Special Rule replaced the Iraq and Afghanistan Service\\nGrant (IASG) and Children of Fallen Heroes (CFH) provisions. This change is no longer new for 2025-2026.')"
