Lack of Clear Information: Borrowers were often not properly informed by financial aid officers or loan servicers about the requirement to repay loans, leading to unawareness of repayment obligations.\\n\\n2. Administrative and Communication Issues: Changes in loan servicers (e.g., transfers without notice), failure to notify borrowers about payment due dates, or updates, and difficulty accessing accurate information online hindered borrowers from making timely payments.\\n\\n3. Problematic Loan Management: Many borrowers experienced discrepancies in their account information, continued interest accrual even during deferment or forbearance, and were unable to receive detailed breakdowns of their loans' interest and balance, making it difficult to understand or manage their debt.\\n\\n4. Limited Payment Options and High Interest: The available options, such as forbearance or deferment, caused interest to accrue rapidly, often negating any payments made and extending the loan payoff period. Borrowers felt their payments were insufficient or unmanageable due to rising interest and stagnant wages.\\n\\n5. Economic Hardship and Misleading Assumptions: Borrowers, especially those not eligible for forgiveness programs, faced financial hardships that made consistent repayment challenging. Many were misled about the affordability and terms of their loans at the outset.\\n\\nIn summary, the failure to pay back loans was largely due to a combination of inadequate communication, administrative issues, unfavorable loan management practices that increased the total debt, and economic difficulties faced by borrowers.\""

The word \"you\" refers to the primary audience of the Handbook, school financial aid\\nadministrators. In other volumes of the Handbook we use \"institution,\" \"school,\" and \"college\" interchangeably, unless a\\nmore specific meaning is provided. In this volume we consistently use the term \"school.\" <HEA= refers to the Higher\\nEducation Act of 1965, as amended. Title IV refers to the student financial aid programs authorized under Title IV of the\\nHEA.\\nWe appreciate any comments that you have on this volume as well as the other volumes of the FSA Handbook. We revise\\nthe text based on questions and feedback from the financial aid community, so please reach out to us about how to\\nimprove the Handbook through the <Contact Customer Support= feature in our Partner Connect9s Help Center clicking on\\n<FSA Handbook= under the Topic section.\\nChanges for 2025-2026\\nThere are no major changes in Volume 3 for 2025-2026. However, we have made minor additions and clarifications to\\nexisting guidance in a few areas, as noted below.\\nChapter 1\\nIn Appendix B, we have added guidance on determining enrollment intensity for Pell Grant recipients who are enrolled in\\nsubscription-based programs.\\nChapter 2\\nWe have revised the discussion of <Allowable Costs= to clarify that for Pell Grant recipients with an enrollment\\nintensity below 50%, the cost of attendance (COA) is still based on the full-year costs for a full-time student. In this\\nsame section, we have also removed text noting that the FAFSA Simplification Act made certain changes to COA\\ncomponents. These changes are no longer new and were previously incorporated into the 2023-2024 FSA Handbook.\\nUnder <Tuition and Fees,= we have added health insurance premiums that are charged to all students as an\\nadditional example of a cost that may be included in this COA component.\\nWe have revised the text under <Costs of Obtaining a License, Certification, or First Professional Credential= to clarify\\nthat the guidance in this section pertains to credentials that are required for a student to practice or participate in\\nthe occupation the program is preparing the student to enter, and have added bar exam fees as an example of one\\nof the types of costs that may be included in this COA component.\\nUnder <Periods of Non-Attendance,= we have added language to clarify that a period of non-attendance is a period\\nduring which the student is not enrolled and is not otherwise engaged in any activity that is a requirement of the\\nstudent9s program of study.\\nChapter 3\\nUnder <Packaging Aid for Certain Dependents of Deceased Servicemembers or Public Safety Officers (Pell Grant Special\\nRule),= we have removed the note explaining that the Pell Grant Special Rule replaced the Iraq and Afghanistan Service\\nGrant (IASG) and Children of Fallen Heroes (CFH) provisions.

            "reference_outputs {'answer': 'Chapter 1 discusses the inclusion of clinical work in standard term periods, emphasizing that clinical experiences meeting specific criteria—such as participation by all students, lack of control over clinical dates, and credit hour alignment—are considered part of standard terms. Chapter 3 outlines the requirements for academic years, including minimum weeks of instructional time and how different program types, like credit-hour or clock-hour programs, define their academic years. Together, these chapters clarify that clinical work meeting the outlined criteria can be incorporated into standard terms, which are governed by the academic year definitions and instructional time requirements specified in Chapter 3, ensuring compliance with Title IV regulations.', 'context': ['<1-hop>\\n\\nInclusion of Clinical Work in a Standard Term Periods of medical and education program clinical work which is conducted outside the classroom may not be included in a standard term, unless all of the following apply: All students in the program must participate in the practicum or clinical experience, and they must be required to complete the practicum or clinical experience as a condition for applying for licensure or authorization to practice the occupation they intend to pursue; The school has little or no control over the length or starting and ending dates of the practicum or clinical experience. This may be due to constraints imposed by outside licensing bodies or the need to accommodate schedules of entities with which students are being placed (e.g., school districts or hospitals); and Credit hours associated with the practicum or clinical experience must be associated with the term in which most of the training occurs, even if the starting and ending dates do not exactly align with the term dates and/or overlap with another term. If the clinical work meets all the above criteria, terms which include such clinical work are not required to be considered nonstandard, nor are such programs required to be considered non-term, even if the clinical work overlaps another term. This flexibility is limited to required clinical periods associated with standard term programs in medicine (including, but not limited to, allopathic, osteopathic, nursing, veterinary, dentistry, pharmacy, and physical therapy), and student teaching required to obtain a state teaching certificate. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for additional guidance on certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement timing rules for Direct Loans when clinical work that meets the criteria described above is included in a standard term. Nonstandard Terms Generally, nonstandard terms are terms that are not semesters, trimesters, or quarters. For example, a 5-week term or a 23-week term would be considered a nonstandard term because no standard term can be fewer than nine weeks or greater than 21 weeks in length. Like standard terms, nonstandard terms may be equal in length or may be of different lengths. If a program is offered in a combination of standard terms and nonstandard terms, the program is considered to be offered in nonstandard terms. Also, like standard terms, nonstandard terms may not overlap within a program. Even if a school calls its terms semesters, trimesters, or quarters, they are considered to be nonstandard terms if they do not comply with the policy on standard term length, as described earlier. For instance, a 22-week semester or an 8-week quarter must be treated as a nonstandard term, because a semester cannot contain more than 21 weeks and a quarter must include a minimum of nine weeks. Semesters, trimesters, or quarters are also considered to be nonstandard terms if academic progress is not measured in the manner normally associated with the type of term. For example, if a program is offered in 15-week semesters but measures academic progress in quarter credit hours, the semesters would be considered nonstandard terms.', '<2-hop>\\n\\nChapter 1 Academic Years, Academic Calendars, Payment Periods, and Disbursements Academic Year Requirements Every eligible program must have a defined academic year. A school may have different academic years for different academic programs. For example, a school may choose to define the academic year for a term-based program differently from a non-term program. In some cases, the academic year definition must be different for different programs, such as in the case of a clock-hour program and a credit-hour program. For Title IV purposes, the academic year is defined in weeks of instructional time and credit or clock hours. The program9s academic year does not have to coincide with the school9s academic calendar (see <Academic year definition and effect on awards= later in the chapter). A school may treat two versions of the same academic program (day and night, for example) as separate programs and define different academic years for each version. If a school establishes separate versions of a program, with different academic years, but allows individual students to take courses from both versions, it must be able to demonstrate which program the student is actually enrolled in. Generally, to be considered enrolled in a particular program or version of a program, a student must be taking most of their coursework in that program. Although a school may have different academic years for different programs, it must use the same academic year definition for all Title IV awards for students enrolled in a particular program, and for all other Title IV program purposes. Weeks of Instructional Time in an Academic Year For both undergraduate and graduate programs, the law and regulations require an academic year to include a minimum number of weeks of instructional time. For a program offered in credit hours, the academic year must include at least 30 weeks of instructional time. For a program offered in clock hours, the academic year must include at least 26 weeks of instructional time. Note: See Volume 2, Chapter 2 for information about academic year requirements for direct assessment programs, which do not measure academic progress using credit or clock hours. The number of weeks of instructional time is based on the period that generally begins on the first day of classes in the academic year and ends on the last day of classes or the last day of examinations, whichever is later. Schools that provide 2- or 4-year associate or baccalaureate degree programs may apply to the Department if they want to request approval to establish a full academic year of less than 30 weeks of instructional time. The Department is permitted to grant a reduction for good cause to no less than 26 weeks of instructional time. These requests are handled on a case-by-case basis. To request approval, contact the School Participation Division that oversees your school. A listing of contact information for the regional School Participation Divisions can be found in the Knowledge Center. For all Title IV programs, a week of instructional time is any period of seven consecutive days in which 3 At least one day of regularly scheduled instruction or examinations occurs, or, after the last scheduled day of classes']}\n",

This ensures that clinical activities are properly integrated into the standard measures used to determine student status, eligibility, and the academic calendar for Title IV purposes.\\n\\nChapter 3 further defines the parameters of the academic year, including how clinical work or internships are counted towards full-time enrollment. It clarifies whether clinical rotations are considered part of the regular academic year, and how they impact the determination of eligibility for federal aid, including disbursement schedules and progress.\\n\\nTogether, these chapters ensure that clinical work is appropriately recognized within the institutional and federal frameworks, aligning the definitions of academic years with the realities of clinical education, so that students’ eligibility for Title IV aid is accurately determined based on the actual structure of their academic programs.\\n\\nIf you need more specific details from the chapters, please let me know!', additional_kwargs={'refusal': None}, response_metadata={'token_usage': {'completion_tokens': 233, 'prompt_tokens': 8995, 'total_tokens': 9228, 'completion_tokens_details': {'accepted_prediction_tokens': 0, 'audio_tokens': 0, 'reasoning_tokens': 0, 'rejected_prediction_tokens': 0}, 'prompt_tokens_details': {'audio_tokens': 0, 'cached_tokens': 0}}, 'model_name': 'gpt-4.1-nano-2025-04-14', 'system_fingerprint': 'fp_38343a2f8f', 'id': 'chatcmpl-ByOEp5va2DN6hP7l3h3qXojGntzP3', 'service_tier': 'default', 'finish_reason': 'stop', 'logprobs': None}, id='run--5e52db7d-5730-4eb0-b2f4-289f8611e299-0', usage_metadata={'input_tokens': 8995, 'output_tokens': 233, 'total_tokens': 9228, 'input_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'cache_read': 0}, 'output_token_details': {'audio': 0, 'reasoning': 0}}), 'context': [Document(metadata={'source': './data/complaints.csv', 'row': 707, 'Date received': '05/07/25', 'Product': 'Student loan', 'Sub-product': 'Federal student loan servicing', 'Issue': 'Struggling to repay your loan', 'Sub-issue': 'Problem with forgiveness, cancellation, or discharge', 'Consumer complaint narrative': \"In 2011, I enrolled at XXXXXXXX XXXX XXXXn XXXX, Texas.

I respectfully request a comprehensive investigation, verification, and validation of the origin, accounting, and legality of the aforementioned loans. Until such time, I request a hold on any collections, wage garnishment, or reporting to credit bureaus. \\nFurthermore, in light of recent legal and administrative developments, including proposed executive actions to restructure the U.S. Department of Education and shift student loan servicing and oversight to other federal agencies such as the Small Business Administration, I seek immediate clarification of how such structural changes may impact the legitimacy and continuity of any outstanding obligations. \\nLegal Basis for Dispute Higher Education Act of 1965 ( 20 U.S.C. 1087e ) : \\\\nUnder this act, federal student loans must comply with very specific disclosure, servicing, and borrower protection requirements. I request copies of all signed master promissory notes ( MPNs ), disbursement records, and evidence of compliance with disclosure requirements. \\nTruth in Lending Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1601 et seq. ) : \\\\nAny entity involved in extending credit or collecting payments must provide clear, timely, and transparent information about terms, interest rates, and repayment options. I dispute whether such disclosures were provided or understood at the time of origination. \\nFair Credit Reporting Act ( 15 U.S.C. 1681 ) : \\\\nIf this loan is being reported to credit bureaus, you are required to ensure that all information is accurate, verifiable, and complete.

I respectfully request a comprehensive investigation, verification, and validation of the origin, accounting, and legality of the aforementioned loans.

            "reference_outputs {'answer': 'Chapter 1 discusses the inclusion of clinical work in standard term periods, emphasizing that clinical experiences meeting specific criteria—such as participation by all students, lack of control over clinical dates, and credit hour alignment—are considered part of standard terms. Chapter 3 outlines the requirements for academic years, including minimum weeks of instructional time and how different program types, like credit-hour or clock-hour programs, define their academic years. Together, these chapters clarify that clinical work meeting the outlined criteria can be incorporated into standard terms, which are governed by the academic year definitions and instructional time requirements specified in Chapter 3, ensuring compliance with Title IV regulations.', 'context': ['<1-hop>\\n\\nInclusion of Clinical Work in a Standard Term Periods of medical and education program clinical work which is conducted outside the classroom may not be included in a standard term, unless all of the following apply: All students in the program must participate in the practicum or clinical experience, and they must be required to complete the practicum or clinical experience as a condition for applying for licensure or authorization to practice the occupation they intend to pursue; The school has little or no control over the length or starting and ending dates of the practicum or clinical experience. This may be due to constraints imposed by outside licensing bodies or the need to accommodate schedules of entities with which students are being placed (e.g., school districts or hospitals); and Credit hours associated with the practicum or clinical experience must be associated with the term in which most of the training occurs, even if the starting and ending dates do not exactly align with the term dates and/or overlap with another term. If the clinical work meets all the above criteria, terms which include such clinical work are not required to be considered nonstandard, nor are such programs required to be considered non-term, even if the clinical work overlaps another term. This flexibility is limited to required clinical periods associated with standard term programs in medicine (including, but not limited to, allopathic, osteopathic, nursing, veterinary, dentistry, pharmacy, and physical therapy), and student teaching required to obtain a state teaching certificate. See Volume 8, Chapter 3 for additional guidance on certain exceptions to the normal loan period and disbursement timing rules for Direct Loans when clinical work that meets the criteria described above is included in a standard term. Nonstandard Terms Generally, nonstandard terms are terms that are not semesters, trimesters, or quarters. For example, a 5-week term or a 23-week term would be considered a nonstandard term because no standard term can be fewer than nine weeks or greater than 21 weeks in length. Like standard terms, nonstandard terms may be equal in length or may be of different lengths. If a program is offered in a combination of standard terms and nonstandard terms, the program is considered to be offered in nonstandard terms. Also, like standard terms, nonstandard terms may not overlap within a program. Even if a school calls its terms semesters, trimesters, or quarters, they are considered to be nonstandard terms if they do not comply with the policy on standard term length, as described earlier. For instance, a 22-week semester or an 8-week quarter must be treated as a nonstandard term, because a semester cannot contain more than 21 weeks and a quarter must include a minimum of nine weeks. Semesters, trimesters, or quarters are also considered to be nonstandard terms if academic progress is not measured in the manner normally associated with the type of term. For example, if a program is offered in 15-week semesters but measures academic progress in quarter credit hours, the semesters would be considered nonstandard terms.', '<2-hop>\\n\\nChapter 1 Academic Years, Academic Calendars, Payment Periods, and Disbursements Academic Year Requirements Every eligible program must have a defined academic year. A school may have different academic years for different academic programs. For example, a school may choose to define the academic year for a term-based program differently from a non-term program. In some cases, the academic year definition must be different for different programs, such as in the case of a clock-hour program and a credit-hour program. For Title IV purposes, the academic year is defined in weeks of instructional time and credit or clock hours. The program9s academic year does not have to coincide with the school9s academic calendar (see <Academic year definition and effect on awards= later in the chapter). A school may treat two versions of the same academic program (day and night, for example) as separate programs and define different academic years for each version. If a school establishes separate versions of a program, with different academic years, but allows individual students to take courses from both versions, it must be able to demonstrate which program the student is actually enrolled in. Generally, to be considered enrolled in a particular program or version of a program, a student must be taking most of their coursework in that program. Although a school may have different academic years for different programs, it must use the same academic year definition for all Title IV awards for students enrolled in a particular program, and for all other Title IV program purposes. Weeks of Instructional Time in an Academic Year For both undergraduate and graduate programs, the law and regulations require an academic year to include a minimum number of weeks of instructional time. For a program offered in credit hours, the academic year must include at least 30 weeks of instructional time. For a program offered in clock hours, the academic year must include at least 26 weeks of instructional time. Note: See Volume 2, Chapter 2 for information about academic year requirements for direct assessment programs, which do not measure academic progress using credit or clock hours. The number of weeks of instructional time is based on the period that generally begins on the first day of classes in the academic year and ends on the last day of classes or the last day of examinations, whichever is later. Schools that provide 2- or 4-year associate or baccalaureate degree programs may apply to the Department if they want to request approval to establish a full academic year of less than 30 weeks of instructional time. The Department is permitted to grant a reduction for good cause to no less than 26 weeks of instructional time. These requests are handled on a case-by-case basis. To request approval, contact the School Participation Division that oversees your school. A listing of contact information for the regional School Participation Divisions can be found in the Knowledge Center. For all Title IV programs, a week of instructional time is any period of seven consecutive days in which 3 At least one day of regularly scheduled instruction or examinations occurs, or, after the last scheduled day of classes']}\n"
