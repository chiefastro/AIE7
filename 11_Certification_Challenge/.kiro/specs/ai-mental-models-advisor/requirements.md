# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The AI Mental Models Advisor is an agentic RAG application designed to help product managers and business strategists navigate the Intelligence Age by leveraging mental models from the "Mental Models for the Intelligence Age" blog article. The system uses a supervisor agent to coordinate three specialized subagents: a vector database retriever for mental models content, a Tavily web search agent for current information, and an Arxiv search agent for academic context. The application aims to help users frame better questions and make more informed strategic decisions in the rapidly evolving AI landscape.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a product manager, I want to ask strategic questions about AI transformation and receive answers grounded in proven mental models, so that I can make better decisions for my company's AI initiatives.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user submits a business strategy question THEN the system SHALL route the query to the appropriate subagent(s) based on the question content
2. WHEN the vector retriever is selected THEN the system SHALL search the mental models knowledge base and return relevant mental model excerpts
3. WHEN a response is generated THEN the system SHALL explicitly reference which mental models are being applied to the user's question
4. WHEN the response is complete THEN the system SHALL provide actionable insights that connect the mental models to the user's specific context

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a business strategist, I want the system to supplement mental model insights with current web information and academic research, so that I can get comprehensive and up-to-date perspectives on my strategic questions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a query requires current market information THEN the supervisor agent SHALL invoke the Tavily web search subagent
2. WHEN a query would benefit from academic context THEN the supervisor agent SHALL invoke the Arxiv search subagent
3. WHEN multiple subagents are used THEN the system SHALL synthesize information from all sources into a coherent response
4. WHEN external sources are used THEN the system SHALL clearly attribute information to its source (web, academic, or mental models)

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user, I want the system to guide me toward asking better questions using the mental models framework, so that I can develop more strategic thinking patterns.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user asks a vague or poorly framed question THEN the system SHALL suggest how to reframe the question using relevant mental models
2. WHEN responding to queries THEN the system SHALL include follow-up question suggestions that leverage other applicable mental models
3. WHEN a mental model is referenced THEN the system SHALL provide a brief explanation of how that model applies to the user's context
4. WHEN appropriate THEN the system SHALL suggest which principles from "R&D as Search" or "Principles of Ideation" could improve the user's approach

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a user, I want to interact with the system through a conversational interface that maintains context across multiple exchanges, so that I can have productive strategic discussions.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user starts a conversation THEN the system SHALL maintain conversation history and context
2. WHEN follow-up questions are asked THEN the system SHALL reference previous exchanges and build upon earlier insights
3. WHEN the system provides responses THEN the interface SHALL clearly display which subagents were used and their contributions
4. WHEN a conversation becomes lengthy THEN the system SHALL summarize key insights and mental models discussed

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a system administrator, I want the application to be properly evaluated and monitored, so that I can ensure it meets quality standards and performs reliably.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the system is deployed THEN it SHALL be evaluated using RAGAS framework metrics including faithfulness, response relevance, context precision, and context recall
2. WHEN queries are processed THEN the system SHALL log interactions for monitoring and evaluation purposes
3. WHEN performance issues are detected THEN the system SHALL provide diagnostic information about which components are underperforming
4. WHEN the system is updated THEN performance SHALL be compared against baseline metrics to ensure improvements
