"Can you explane how the concept of Skillenai influences the redesign of business workflows in the Intelligence Age, especially considering the analogy of the 'Engine in a Buggy'?","['# Mental Models for the Intelligence Age - Skillenai The world is transitioning from the Information Age to the Intelligence Age.

Instead of simply automating individual steps within complex existing processes, it is more effective and efficient to redesign entire workflows from scratch. This approach is likened to not putting an engine in a buggy designed for a horse, but rather designing a new car for the engine. Businesses built before the emergence of large language models (LLMs) resemble buggies powered by horses, and replacing horses with AI without redesigning the system misses the bigger picture.

This approach aligns with the principle of balancing exploration and exploitation in R&D, accelerating learning and innovation cycles. Concurrently, the strategy of avoiding the AI steamroller involves not building redundant chat interfaces within web apps, since frontier labs like Microsoft are shipping AI-native browsers and browser agents that provide chat interfaces across multiple tabs. Instead, builders are encouraged to develop tools that connect proprietary data to these browser agents or create custom web pages designed for agent access, thereby focusing on parts of the value chain that frontier models cannot absorb. Together, Microsoft’s hackathons foster rapid ideation and validation, while their AI-native browser strategy helps organizations build defensible AI tools that resist commoditization and platform risk.",multi_hop_specific_query_synthesizer

"How does Microsoft exemplify the integration of AI-native design principles by leveraging large-scale company-wide hackathons and rapid feedback loops to accelerate innovation, and why are these approaches critical in balancing exploration and exploitation within R&D organizations?","['<1-hop>\n\nAvoid the AI Steamroller > Treat frontier models like rapidly-improving public infrastructure—great to ride on, fatal to stand under. Build the parts of the value chain that infrastructure can’t, or won’t, absorb. > > o3 What this means in July 2025 is this: avoid chat interfaces within your web app. Frontier labs are now shipping AI-native browsers (like Comet from Perplexity) and agents that can use browsers (like OpenAI’s ChatGPT Agent). With browser agents, users will have a chat interface built into their browser, so you don’t need to build one in your app. And their browser agent can operate across multiple tabs of the browser, which your in-app chat interface can never do. The play becomes building MCP tools that connect your data to those browser agents, or creating custom web pages meant to be accessed by an agent instead of a human. And building browser extensions that can solve vertical workflows across multiple apps may be another path forward for AI builders. But let’s zoom out a bit on this concept of avoiding the AI steamroller. Here’s AI’s take on it: _Sam Altman’s blunt warning to founders—“we’re going to steam-roll you” if your product is just a thin wrapper on today’s GPT-4-style APIs—captures the new platform risk of the intelligence age . In the same spirit that Apple sherlocked single-feature iOS apps and Google subsumed SEO point-solutions, the frontier-model labs (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Meta, Microsoft, et al.) will keep folding the “obvious” point features into ever-more capable base models._ _**The lesson:** if your value proposition disappears the moment GPT-5 ships, you’re standing on the tracks._ **_ Where the steamroller can’t reach — nine strategic “safe-zones”_** **Safe-zone**| **Why it resists commoditisation**| **Practical moves & examples** ---|---|--- **Proprietary or hard-to-get data**| Foundational models train on public corpora; your private telemetry, labelled edge-data or regulated records stay out of reach.| Build data-network effects (usage ⇒ new data ⇒ better model). Venture VCs now rank “unique data” the strongest moat for Gen-AI startups . **Deep domain expertise**| Frontier labs optimise for _general_ intelligence; niche science, legal or biotech workflows need domain context humans spent years acquiring.| Anthropic’s Mike Krieger points to specialised verticals—“I don’t see us solving lab-automation any time soon” . Hire/prioritise operators who lived the pain. **Workflow lock-in & systems-of-record**| If you own the daily operating system (docs, tickets, supply-chain, EMR), models become replaceable modules behind the scenes.| Move “up-stack” from insight → action → transaction; integrate approvals, compliance, billing. **Real-time or edge context**| Latency, privacy or offline constraints force local inference or hybrid architectures Big Tech won’t customise.| Combine on-device small models with cloud LLM calls; add physical sensors or custom hardware. **Regulatory & compliance shields**| Heavily regulated verticals (health, finance, defense) impose certifications cloud labs won’t chase.| Secure SOC-2/ISO, embed audit trails, offer private-cloud or on-prem fine-tuning. **Human-in-the-loop services**| Models supply 80 % of the answer; you monetise the last-mile QA, curation, relationship, liability.| Examples: AI-augmented legal review, clinical scribing with licensed physicians, AI plus expert forums. **New interfaces & UX innovation**| Labs expose APIs, not magical product experiences.

By allocating resources according to the 70-20-10 portfolio rule—70% on core bets, 20% on adjacent ideas, and 10% on wild experiments—Microsoft ensures a constant budget for high-uncertainty, high-potential bets while sustaining core activities.
